Emphasizes that cafeteria services, which have gained importance in educational institutions, not only meet nutritional needs but also shape social and cultural experiences

As a result, through the analysis and the use of various regression models, effective tools for assessing the quality of cafeteria services were obtained. The linear regression model performed well with a high correlation coefficient, demonstrating a strong predictive ability on product quality assessment. At the same time, the SMOreg regression model also played an important role in the analysis by providing an effective predictive ability on food palatability assessment. These findings enable the evaluation of various strategies for improving dining hall services and increasing user satisfaction. In particular, through the use of linear regression and SMOreg models, strengths and weaknesses in dining hall services can be identified and targeted improvements can be made. The analytical perspective offered by these models can help cafeteria operators to make informed decisions about menu planning, hours of service arrangements, and strengthening hygiene standards. Based on the results of the analysis, potential improvements can be identified to increase user satisfaction with cafeteria services. For example, steps can be taken to increase menu variety by focusing on the best-performing attributes or to strengthen hygiene standards. Furthermore, the predictions obtained from regression models can be used to assess the potential impacts of planned changes in advance. In this context, developing forward-looking strategies to improve the quality of cafeteria services and maximize user satisfaction can provide a significant competitive advantage for organizations. In conclusion, this study has made a valuable contribution to the evaluation and improvement of cafeteria services.
